  In the present QuantNBody tutorials, we detail how the package can be used in practice for fermionic and bosonic systems.
  In addition to what is discussed and presented here, we provide the new user with a series of Jupyter-noebooks and Python scripts presenting practical examples of package application.
  Python scripts with practical examples of the application of the packages.
