A Python package for quantum chemistry and physics.
===============================================================

**QuantNBody** is a python package facilitating the implementation and manipulation of quantum many-body systems
composed of fermions or bosons.
It provides a quick and easy way to build many-body operators and wavefunctions and get access
(in a few python lines) to quantities and objects of interest for theoretical research and method developements.
This tool can be also of a great help for pedagogical purpose and to help illustrating numerical methods for fermionic or bosonic systems.
